# Power BI Report in an Hour Workshop

## Power BI Report in an Hour

In this workshop we will use [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) to analyze COVID-19 data for the US.

[Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/fundamentals/power-bi-overview) is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.
