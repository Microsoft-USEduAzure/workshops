# Summary 
In this module, you've explored several Azure services and connected them together.

You built a solution that feeds data from a simulated array of cameras into an [Azure IoT hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-hub/), uploads photographs to [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/?v=16.50), processes the data using [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics/), stores IoT messages in a queue with [Azure Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-bus/), uses [Azure Logic App](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/) to analyze the photographs using the [Custom Vision Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/), stores the data in an [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/), and visualizes the output using [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com).

It's a sophisticated solution that has shown you how to:

- Inject streaming data with Azure IoT Hub
- Analyze the data with Azure Stream Analytics
- Use Logic Apps to interface with Azure Cognitive Services
- Use Cognitive Services to predict results
- Use Power BI to visualize the output

# Clean up

It's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.

You can also delete the Custom Vision Service project if you like. Just open the project and click the "trash can" icon on the Polar Bear Project tile listed on the Projects page.
